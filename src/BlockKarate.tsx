      <h2>I'm a Black Belt Karate Teacher</h2>

      <p>
        I've been practicing Kyokushin Karate since 1995. I've known hundreds of
        people while practicing, learning, competing, teaching and sharing a
        good time through karate events.

        In 2004 I was lucky enough to fully dedicate myself to the practice of
        karate. I was part of an uchi deshi program (internship student) at the
        I.K.O. Kyokushinkaikan New York City dojo for 1 month and then at their
        honbu dojo in Ikebukuro, Tokyo for 4 months. Needless to say, these
        experiences had a positive impact on my entire life.

        I participated in 4 Kyokushin World Open Weight Karate Tournaments in
        Japan, in the years 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2011. Feel free to check some
        of my fights in my
