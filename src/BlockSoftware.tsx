        <span>Since 2022</span> I worked for Microsoft as a software engineer. I
        was part of a team that handles maintenance and development of two
        enterprise platform services that support communication APIs and provide
        very critical, large-scale data for other back-end services. These
        services were aggressively scaled in 2020 to meet the demands of remote
        work during the pandemic.
